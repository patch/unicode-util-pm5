NAME
    Unicode::Util - Unicode-aware versions of built-in Perl functions

VERSION
    This document describes Unicode::Util version 0.01.

SYNOPSIS
        use Unicode::Util;

        # grapheme cluster: Cyrillic small letter yu + combining acute accent
        my $grapheme = "\x{44E}\x{301}";

        say graph_length($grapheme);  # 1
        say code_length($grapheme);   # 2
        say byte_length($grapheme);   # 4

DESCRIPTION
    This module provides additional versions of Perl’s built-in functions,
    tailored to work on three different units:

    *   graph: Unicode extended grapheme clusters (graphemes)

    *   code: Unicode codepoints

    *   byte: 8-bit bytes (octets)

    This is an early release and this module is likely to have major
    revisions. Only the "length"-functions are currently implemented. See
    the "TODO" section for planned future additions.

FUNCTIONS
    graph_length($string)
        Returns the length in graphemes of the given string. This is likely
        the number of "characters" that many people would count on a printed
        string, plus non-printing characters.

    code_length($string)
        Returns the length in codepoints of the given string. This is likely
        the number of "characters" that many programmers and programming
        languages would count in a string.

    byte_length($string)
        Returns the length in bytes of the given string encoded as UTF-8.
        This is the number of bytes that many computers would count when
        storing a string.

TODO
    Evaluate the following core Perl functions and operators for the
    potential addition to this module.

    "chop", "reverse", "split", "substr", "index", "rindex", "eq", "ne",
    "lt", "gt", "le", "ge", "cmp"

SEE ALSO
    The "length"-functions are based on methods provided by Perl6::Str.
