NAME
    Unicode::Util - Unicode grapheme-level versions of built-in Perl
    functions

VERSION
    This document describes Unicode::Util version 0.06_1.

SYNOPSIS
        use Unicode::Util qw( grapheme_length grapheme_reverse grapheme_split );

        # grapheme cluster ю́ (Cyrillic small letter yu, combining acute accent)
        my $grapheme = "\x{044E}\x{0301}";

        say length($grapheme);           # 2 (length in code points)
        say grapheme_length($grapheme);  # 1 (length in grapheme clusters)

        # Spın̈al Tap; n̈ = Latin small letter n, combining diaeresis
        my $band = "Sp\x{0131}n\x{0308}al Tap";

        say scalar reverse $band;     # paT länıpS
        say grapheme_reverse($band);  # paT lan̈ıpS

        say join ' ', split //, $band;        # S p ı n ̈ a l   T a p
        say join ' ', grapheme_split($band);  # S p ı n̈ a l   T a p

DESCRIPTION
    This module provides Unicode grapheme cluster–level versions of Perl’s
    built-in string functions, tailored to work on grapheme clusters as
    opposed to code points or bytes.

FUNCTIONS
    Functions may each be exported explicitly or by using the ":all" tag for
    everything.

    grapheme_length($string)
        Returns the length of the given string in grapheme clusters. This is
        the closest to the number of “characters” that many people would
        count on a printed string.

    grapheme_chop($string)
        Returns the given string with the last grapheme cluster chopped off.
        Does not modify the original value, unlike the built-in "chop".

    grapheme_reverse($string)
        Returns the given string value with all grapheme clusters in the
        opposite order.

    grapheme_split($string)
        Splits a string into a list of strings for each grapheme cluster and
        returns that list. This is simular to "split(//, $string)", except
        that it splits between grapheme clusters.

    grapheme_index($string, $substring)
    grapheme_index($string, $substring, $position)
        Searches for one string within another and returns the position in
        grapheme clusters of the first occurrence of $substring in $string
        at or after the optional grapheme cluster $position. If the position
        is omitted, starts searching from the beginning of the string. A
        position before the beginning of the string or after its end is
        treated as if it were the beginning or the end, respectively. The
        position and return value are based at zero. If the substring is not
        found, "grapheme_index" returns -1.

    grapheme_rindex($string, $substring)
    grapheme_rindex($string, $substring, $position)
        Works just like "grapheme_index" except that it returns the position
        in grapheme clusters of the last occurrence of $substring in
        $string. If $position is specified, returns the last occurrence
        beginning at or before that position in grapheme clusters.

TODO
    "grapheme_substr"
