NAME
    Unicode::Util - Unicode grapheme-level versions of built-in Perl
    functions

VERSION
    This document describes Unicode::Util version 0.07_1.

SYNOPSIS
        use Unicode::Util qw( grapheme_length grapheme_reverse );

        # grapheme cluster ю́ (Cyrillic small letter yu, combining acute accent)
        my $grapheme = "ю\x{0301}";

        say length($grapheme);           # 2 (length in code points)
        say grapheme_length($grapheme);  # 1 (length in grapheme clusters)

        # Spın̈al Tap; n̈ = Latin small letter n, combining diaeresis
        my $band = "Spın\x{0308}al Tap";

        say scalar reverse $band;     # paT länıpS
        say grapheme_reverse($band);  # paT lan̈ıpS

DESCRIPTION
    This module provides Unicode grapheme cluster–level versions of Perl’s
    built-in string functions, tailored to work on grapheme clusters as
    opposed to code points or bytes. Grapheme clusters correspond to
    user-perceived characters and may consist of multiple code points.

    These functions are implemented using the "\X" character class, which
    was introduced in Perl v5.6 and significantly improved in v5.12 to
    properly match Unicode extended grapheme clusters. An example of a
    notable change is that CR+LF <0x0D 0x0A> is now considered a single
    grapheme cluster instead of two. For that reason, as well as additional
    Unicode improvements, Perl v5.12 or greater is strongly recommended,
    both for use with this module and as a language in general.

FUNCTIONS
    These functions may each be exported explicitly or by using the ":all"
    tag for everything.

    grapheme_length($string)
    grapheme_length
        Works like "length" except the length is in number of grapheme
        clusters.

    grapheme_chop($string)
    grapheme_chop(@array)
    grapheme_chop(%hash)
    grapheme_chop
        Works like "chop" except it operates on the last grapheme cluster.

    grapheme_reverse($string)
    grapheme_reverse(@list)
    grapheme_reverse
        Works like "reverse" except it reverses grapheme clusters in scalar
        context.

    grapheme_index($string, $substring, $position)
    grapheme_index($string, $substring)
        Works like "index" except the position is in grapheme clusters.

    grapheme_rindex($string, $substring, $position)
    grapheme_rindex($string, $substring)
        Works like "rindex" except the position is in grapheme clusters.

    grapheme_substr($string, $offset, $length, $replacement)
    grapheme_substr($string, $offset, $length)
    grapheme_substr($string, $offset)
        Works like "substr" except the offset and length are in grapheme
        clusters.
