NAME
    Unicode::Util - Unicode grapheme-level versions of built-in Perl
    functions

VERSION
    This document describes Unicode::Util version 0.07.

SYNOPSIS
        use Unicode::Util qw( grapheme_length grapheme_reverse );

        # grapheme cluster ю́ (Cyrillic small letter yu, combining acute accent)
        my $grapheme = "\x{044E}\x{0301}";

        say length($grapheme);           # 2 (length in code points)
        say grapheme_length($grapheme);  # 1 (length in grapheme clusters)

        # Spın̈al Tap; n̈ = Latin small letter n, combining diaeresis
        my $band = "Sp\x{0131}n\x{0308}al Tap";

        say scalar reverse $band;     # paT länıpS
        say grapheme_reverse($band);  # paT lan̈ıpS

DESCRIPTION
    This module provides Unicode grapheme cluster–level versions of Perl’s
    built-in string functions, tailored to work on grapheme clusters as
    opposed to code points or bytes.

    This is an early release and major revisions are planned for the near
    future.

FUNCTIONS
    Functions may each be exported explicitly or by using the ":all" tag for
    everything.

    grapheme_length($string)
        Returns the length of the given string in grapheme clusters. This is
        the closest to the number of “characters” that many people would
        count on a printed string.

    grapheme_chop($string)
        Returns the given string with the last grapheme cluster chopped off.
        Does not modify the original value, unlike the built-in "chop".

    grapheme_reverse($string)
        Returns the given string value with all grapheme clusters in the
        opposite order.

TODO
    "grapheme_substr", "graphem_index", "grapheme_rindex", "canonical_eq",
    "compatibility_eq"
